# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This is my first end-to-end **machine learning project**, where I’ve built a classification model using the **Iris flower dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project helped me understand the **complete ML workflow** — from data analysis and visualization to model building and evaluation. ✨

## 📌 Steps Followed

### 1. Importing Required Libraries
Used essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn`.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
Loaded the built-in iris dataset from sklearn and converted it to a pandas DataFrame.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked dataset shape and class distribution.
- Visualized feature relationships using pairplots and histograms.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing/null values.
- Ensured clean and usable data.

### 5. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Achieved high classification performance.
