🌸 Iris Classification Project
A Machine Learning project to classify Iris flower species using supervised learning. This notebook includes end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and conclusion.

📌 Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic multiclass classification problem. In this project, we aim to:
Understand the dataset through in-depth EDA
Visualize the patterns and relationships among features
Apply classification algorithms to predict the species
Evaluate model performance using various metrics

🧠 Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed a detailed EDA using:
Distribution plots (seaborn)
Boxplots and violin plots for outlier detection
Pairplots and heatmaps for correlation
Class balance checks
Summary statistics and feature insights

🔄 Data Preprocessing
Checked for nulls and data types
Label Encoding for target variable
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Split into train and test sets

🧪 Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
Confusion Matrix
The best-performing model was selected based on test accuracy and F1-score.

📝 Results
Achieved high accuracy (>95%) on multiple models
Random Forest and SVM gave the best overall results
Clean, interpretable visualizations support the insights

💻 Tech Stack
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
