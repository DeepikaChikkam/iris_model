# Iris Model

This project is a simple machine learning model trained on the famous *Iris dataset. It classifies iris flowers into three species: *Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on features like petal and sepal length/width.

## Features
- Uses Scikit-learn and Pandas
- Trained a Decision Tree / Logistic Regression / SVM (based on your notebook)
- Basic accuracy evaluation and predictions

## Files
- iris_model.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/DeepikaChikkam/iris_model.git
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook iris_model.ipynb

## Future Improvements
- Add visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn
- Try other models like Random Forest or KNN
- Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
